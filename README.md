## To users ❤️ (Update note ..Not important 😅)
As coins and exchanges increase, it's too narrow to fit in the popup.
How do you at a glance! Do not be mad! neatly! I'm worried about whether I can show you!

In the next major update, I will return to add function, not to add exchanges or coins!
An alarm at a fixed price or something visual so you can better understand the change in the price!
Actually, I do not make money with this app, but because I am so funny and need to make an app, it may be a little slower and you may not feel uncomfortable.
You have a suggestion or something to say about Coinnow! 
Request issues in Github or send an e-mail to twlovesh89@gmail.com. I'll reply you ASAP :D hehe

Every time I leave work and start working until dawn, I'm almost out of my mind and I am writing down the update notes! Hehe
I hope Coinow will help you a little bit!
Obviously users do not have much to read this update note to the end, but ~
Please do a lot of Coinnow promotion ~ I love you users!
